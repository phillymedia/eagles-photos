(For reference from Gammage story in doccenter: The longest and loudest ovations were for H.F. "Gerry" Lenfest, the former owner of the Inquirer, Daily News, and Philly.com whose years of dogged advocacy helped create the museum. That struggle went on longer than the war itself, which lasted eight years, from 1775 to 1783.)
